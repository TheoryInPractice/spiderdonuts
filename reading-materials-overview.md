### Matrix functions and walk-entropy

* Dehmer [Information processing in complex networks: Graph entropy and information functionals](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1d9c/8baffc26d46beceaa71279a9dd4a629459e7.pdf)

Introduces a framework for defining the entropy of a graph.

* Higham and Estrada, [Network Properties Revealed through Matrix Functions](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/090761070)

Describes some basic properties of graph matrices that make matrix functions useful for analyzing network structure.

* Estrada and de la Pena, [Maximum walk entropy implies walk regularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5056)

This paper is difficult to read (uses notation from another field), but is necessary to cite for work related to walk entropy: the main result is that the matrix exponential guarantees "diag(exp(A)) is constant iff A is walk-regular"

* Benzi, [A note on walk entropies in graphs](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379513008227)

The concept of walk entropy of a graph has been recently introduced in E. Estrada et al. (2014) [4]. In that paper the authors formulated two conjectures about walk entropies. In the present note we prove the first of these two conjectures and propose a stronger form of it.
