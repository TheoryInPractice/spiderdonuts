### Matrix functions and walk-entropy

* Higham and Estrada, [Network Properties Revealed through Matrix Functions](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/090761070)

Describes some basic properties of graph matrices that make matrix functions useful for analyzing network structure.

* Estrada and de la Pena, [Maximum walk entropy implies walk regularity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5056)

This paper is difficult to read (uses notation from another field), but is necessary to cite for work related to walk entropy: the main result is that the matrix exponential guarantees "diag(exp(A)) is constant iff A is walk-regular"
