## Main research focuses

One pillar of this project, which we'll call "Walk Entropy", studies the information about a graph encoded by its walk structure, and studies a graph's walk structure by looking at polynomials and functions of graph matrices.

For now, the goal here is to better understand how a graphs' walks and matrix functions relate to each other, and design some Python codes for glueing together different kinds of graphs where we can test our findings in a concrete setting. The kinds of graphs we'll want to put together will be highly structured / symmetric, like hypercubes or polygons we fit together to make polyhedra.
